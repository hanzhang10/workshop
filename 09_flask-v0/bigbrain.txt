K09: First Flask App Q/C/C 
2021-10-02

Q0: Reminds me of creating an object from a certain class in Java
Q1: "/" usually denotes file pathing
Q2: It should print the name of the program somewhere in bash/terminal.
Q3: This should appear on the app or website, in this case http://127.0.0.1:5000/ .
Q4: This syntax reminds me of Java when you call a function from a class. app would be the object and run() would be the function.

After running:
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/ gives nothing from local pc; maybe it will work on a lab computer?
- Update: created a venv on local pc and ran app.py, the url displays "No hablo queso!"
